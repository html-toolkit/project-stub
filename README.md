# HTML Toolkit / Project Stub

When you start a new project you need some defined initial file structure and `package.json` with bunch of dev dependencies.
You can avoid to handle with it manually using this project stub.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/html-toolkit/project-stub.git my-new-project && cd my-new-project
$ npm install
```

After package manager install all dependencies you could start:

```
$ npm start
```

This will turn on `grunt watch` and `grunt server` tasks.
